For assistance or issue reporting, please use the Open Ticket feature through the provided support portal. Email support is currently unavailable. All service requests and technical inquiries are processed exclusively through the ticket system to ensure structured, prompt, and well-documented handling.

Additionally, the support team is also available via Discord and Support Mail for initial communication, casual discussions, or non-technical questions. However, all official requests must still be submitted through the ticket system to ensure they are handled systematically according to standard operating procedures.
